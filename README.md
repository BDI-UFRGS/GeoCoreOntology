# GeoCore Ontology

GeoCore Ontology is a core ontology for general use in Geology. It contains a limited set of concepts that are shared among various subdomains of Geology. Having a common core set of concepts is key in order to integrate and develop knowledge bases in the domain.

GeoCore is a collaborative effort between the Informatics Institute at UFRGS (Brazil) and Geosiris Company (France).
