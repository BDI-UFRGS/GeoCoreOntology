property_value: IAO:0000116 "A geological object is a naturally occurring entity because a geological process\ngenerates it, and some earth material constitutes it. Thus, we can differentiate geological objects from artificial objects, such as a well-core, because even though some earth material constitutes artificial objects, they are human-made rather than generated by some geological process. Furthermore, Geological Objects are specializations of BFO Objects, meaning they must necessarily have some unity criteria. The unity is what differentiates geological objects from Earth Materials." xsd:string

The pattern comprises the material configuration and the mutual relationships of the object’s different parts. Structures result from one or a series of geological processes that generated or transformed the geological object they generically depend on. Thus, there is some historical dependence relation between the structure and this geological process, but what concretizes the structure is some complex quality inhering in the object, not the process." xsd:string

Since they are amounts, they don’t hold unity criteria, but they are ontologically rigid and provide an identity criteria. Earth Materials and BFO Objects are disjoint. They are either solid, fluid, or unconsolidated.

These particles are usually geological objects, such as grains or crystals, or the rest of dead animals or plants. \n\nAmounts of rock, like other earth materials, are independent rigid entities that do not hold any unity criteria.
