property_value: IAO:0000116 "A geological object is a naturally occurring entity because a geological process\ngenerates it, and some earth material constitutes it. Thus, we can differentiate geological objects from artificial objects, such as a well-core, because even though some earth material constitutes artificial objects, they are human-made rather than generated by some geological process. Furthermore, Geological Objects are specializations of BFO Objects, meaning they must necessarily have some unity criteria. The unity is what differentiates geological objects from Earth Materials." xsd:string

Since they are amounts, they don’t hold unity criteria, but they are ontologically rigid and provide an identity criteria. Earth Materials and BFO Objects are disjoint.
